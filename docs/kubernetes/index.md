In late 2017 my day job included part of Kubernetes involvement as part of the migration of FreshBooks services to Google's hosted Kubernetes platform, GKE. Early in 2018 my involvement ramped up and that informed my decision to deepen my involvement with Kubernetes and take a position at Red Hat later that year. In my personal time I've built a [Rock64 Kubernetes cluster](/kubernetes/rock64-cluster.html) to use as a lab.

Many of my contributions to the Kubernetes landscape can be found in the [openshift](https://github.com/openshift/) organization. Others are sort of one-off projects that came from need the [Rock64 Kubernetes cluster](/kubernetes/rock64-cluster.html) I built.
